# Dental-Cavity-Classification
Objective
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify dental X-ray images into two categories: caries and no caries.

# Overview:
# Dental cavities, or caries, are a common dental issue that can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. Accurate and timely detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to assist in the automated classification of dental X-ray images, potentially aiding dentists in diagnosis.

Project Components
Data Preprocessing:

Image Normalization and Augmentation: Standardized the images for uniform input into the models. Applied augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset and improve model robustness.
Label Encoding: Encoded image labels to categorize them into caries and no caries.
Model Development:

Custom CNN Model: Designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras with a TensorFlow backend to classify the images.
Transfer Learning Models: Integrated and compared the custom CNN with four pre-trained transfer learning models:
MobileNet
ResNet50
VGG16
InceptionV3
Model Training and Evaluation:

Training: Trained the custom CNN and transfer learning models on the preprocessed dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Comparison: Compared the performance of the custom CNN with the transfer learning models to identify the best-performing model.
Results and Analysis:

Performance Metrics: Detailed analysis of model performance metrics.
Visualizations: Graphical representation of model accuracy and loss over training epochs, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to the field of dental health. The comparative analysis of the custom CNN and transfer learning models provides insights into the effectiveness of different architectures for dental cavity classification.
